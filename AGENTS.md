## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

- `laravel-best-practices` — Apply this skill whenever writing, reviewing, or refactoring Laravel PHP code. This includes creating or modifying controllers, models, migrations, form requests, policies, jobs, scheduled commands, service classes, and Eloquent queries. Triggers for N+1 and query performance issues, caching strategies, authorization and security patterns, validation, error handling, queue and job configuration, route definitions, and architectural decisions. Also use for Laravel code reviews and refactoring existing Laravel code to follow best practices. Covers any task involving Laravel backend PHP code patterns.
- `configuring-horizon` — Use this skill whenever the user mentions Horizon by name in a Laravel context. Covers the full Horizon lifecycle: installing Horizon (horizon:install, Sail setup), configuring config/horizon.php (supervisor blocks, queue assignments, balancing strategies, minProcesses/maxProcesses), fixing the dashboard (authorization via Gate::define viewHorizon, blank metrics, horizon:snapshot scheduling), and troubleshooting production issues (worker crashes, timeout chain ordering, LongWaitDetected notifications, waits config). Also covers job tagging and silencing. Do not use for generic Laravel queues without Horizon, SQS or database drivers, standalone Redis setup, Linux supervisord, Telescope, or job batching.
- `pulse-development` — Handles Laravel Pulse setup, configuration, and custom card development. Activates when installing Pulse; configuring the dashboard or authorization gate; setting up recorders and filtering; building custom Livewire cards; optimizing with Redis ingest or sampling; or when the user mentions /pulse, pulse:check, pulse:work, Pulse::record(), or application monitoring.
- `livewire-development` — Use for any task or question involving Livewire. Activate if user mentions Livewire, wire: directives, or Livewire-specific concepts like wire:model, wire:click, wire:sort, or islands, invoke this skill. Covers building new components, debugging reactivity issues, real-time form validation, drag-and-drop, loading states, migrating from Livewire 3 to 4, converting component formats (SFC/MFC/class-based), and performance optimization. Do not use for non-Livewire reactive UI (React, Vue, Alpine-only, Inertia.js) or standard Laravel forms without Livewire.
- `pest-testing` — Use this skill for Pest PHP testing in Laravel projects only. Trigger whenever any test is being written, edited, fixed, or refactored — including fixing tests that broke after a code change, adding assertions, converting PHPUnit to Pest, adding datasets, and TDD workflows. Always activate when the user asks how to write something in Pest, mentions test files or directories (tests/Feature, tests/Unit, tests/Browser), or needs browser testing, smoke testing multiple pages for JS errors, or architecture tests. Covers: test()/it()/expect() syntax, datasets, mocking, browser testing (visit/click/fill), smoke testing, arch(), Livewire component tests, RefreshDatabase, and all Pest 4 features. Do not use for factories, seeders, migrations, controllers, models, or non-test PHP code.
- `tailwindcss-development` — Always invoke when the user's message includes 'tailwind' in any form. Also invoke for: building responsive grid layouts (multi-column card grids, product grids), flex/grid page structures (dashboards with sidebars, fixed topbars, mobile-toggle navs), styling UI components (cards, tables, navbars, pricing sections, forms, inputs, badges), adding dark mode variants, fixing spacing or typography, and Tailwind v3/v4 work. The core use case: writing or fixing Tailwind utility classes in HTML templates (Blade, JSX, Vue). Skip for backend PHP logic, database queries, API routes, JavaScript with no HTML/CSS component, CSS file audits, build tool configuration, and vanilla CSS.
- `laravel-permission-development` — Build and work with Spatie Laravel Permission features, including roles, permissions, middleware, policies, teams, and Blade directives.
- `debug-using-debugbar` — Use this skill to optimize requests or debug Laravel application issues — slow pages, N+1 queries, exceptions, failed requests, or unexpected behavior — by inspecting data captured by Laravel Debugbar via Artisan CLI commands. Use when the user asks to investigate a bug, diagnose a slow request, find duplicate queries, check what happened on a previous request, or optimize database performance, even if they don't explicitly mention "debugbar" or "profiling."

- `eloquent-best-practices` — Best practices for Laravel Eloquent ORM including query optimization, relationship management, and avoiding common pitfalls like N+1 queries.
- `fluxui-development` — Use this skill for Flux UI development in Livewire applications only. Trigger when working with <flux:\*> components, building or customizing Livewire component UIs, creating forms, modals, tables, or other interactive elements. Covers: flux: components (buttons, inputs, modals, forms, tables, date-pickers, kanban, badges, tooltips, etc.), component composition, Tailwind CSS styling, Heroicons/Lucide icon integration, validation patterns, responsive design, and theming. Do not use for non-Livewire frameworks or non-component styling.
- `laravel-expert` — Senior Laravel Engineer role for production-grade, maintainable, and idiomatic Laravel solutions. Focuses on clean architecture, security, performance, and modern standards (Laravel 10/11+).
- `laravel-inertia-react` — Laravel + Inertia.js + React integration patterns. Use when building Inertia page components, handling forms with useForm, managing shared data, or implementing persistent layouts. Triggers on tasks involving Inertia.js, page props, form handling, or Laravel React integration.
- `laravel-patterns` — Laravel architecture patterns, routing/controllers, Eloquent ORM, service layers, queues, events, caching, and API resources for production apps.
- `laravel-routes-best-practices` — Keep routes clean and focused on mapping requests to controllers; avoid business logic, validation, or database operations in route files
- `laravel-security` — Laravel security best practices for authn/authz, validation, CSRF, mass assignment, file uploads, secrets, rate limiting, and secure deployment.
- `laravel-security-audit` — Security auditor for Laravel applications. Analyzes code for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and insecure practices using OWASP standards and Laravel security best practices.
- `laravel-specialist` — Build and configure Laravel 10+ applications, including creating Eloquent models and relationships, implementing Sanctum authentication, configuring Horizon queues, designing RESTful APIs with API resources, and building reactive interfaces with Livewire. Use when creating Laravel models, setting up queue workers, implementing Sanctum auth flows, building Livewire components, optimising Eloquent queries, or writing Pest/PHPUnit tests for Laravel features.
- `php-best-practices` — PHP 8.x modern patterns, PSR standards, and SOLID principles. Use when reviewing PHP code, checking type safety, auditing code quality, or ensuring PHP best practices. Triggers on "review PHP", "check PHP code", "audit PHP", or "PHP best practices".
- `php-pro` — Use when building PHP applications with modern PHP 8.3+ features, Laravel, or Symfony frameworks. Invokes strict typing, PHPStan level 9, async patterns with Swoole, and PSR standards. Creates controllers, configures middleware, generates migrations, writes PHPUnit/Pest tests, defines typed DTOs and value objects, sets up dependency injection, and scaffolds REST/GraphQL APIs. Use when working with Eloquent, Doctrine, Composer, Psalm, ReactPHP, or any PHP API development.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If the user doesn't see a frontend change reflected in the UI, it could mean they need to run `npm run build`, `npm run dev`, or `composer run dev`. Ask them.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

## Replies

- Be concise in your explanations - focus on what's important rather than explaining obvious details.

=== boost rules ===

# Laravel Boost

## Tools

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server with tools designed specifically for this application. Prefer Boost tools over manual alternatives like shell commands or file reads.
- Use `database-query` to run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- Use `database-schema` to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- Use `get-absolute-url` to resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- Use `browser-logs` to read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful, ignore old entries.

## Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- Always use `search-docs` before making code changes. Do not skip this step. It returns version-specific docs based on installed packages automatically.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do not add package names to queries because package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Search Syntax

1. Use words for auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. Use `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.
- To check environment variables, read the `.env` file directly.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
    - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Use TitleCase for Enum keys: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== deployments rules ===

# Deployment

- Laravel can be deployed using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/), which is the fastest way to deploy and scale production Laravel applications.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

## APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

## Vite Error

- If you receive an "Illuminate\Foundation\ViteException: Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, you can run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

=== livewire/core rules ===

# Livewire

- Livewire allow to build dynamic, reactive interfaces in PHP without writing JavaScript.
- You can use Alpine.js for client-side interactions instead of JavaScript frameworks.
- Keep state server-side so the UI reflects it. Validate and authorize in actions as you would in HTTP requests.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== pest/core rules ===

## Pest

- This project uses Pest for testing. Create tests: `php artisan make:test --pest {name}`.
- Run tests: `php artisan test --compact` or filter: `php artisan test --compact --filter=testName`.
- Do NOT delete tests without approval.

=== spatie/laravel-activitylog rules ===

# spatie/laravel-activitylog

Activity logging package for Laravel. Logs model events and manual activities to a database table.

## Key Concepts

- **Activity**: An Eloquent model (`Spatie\Activitylog\Models\Activity`) storing log entries with subject, causer, event, attribute_changes, and properties.
- **Subject**: The model being acted upon (polymorphic `subject_type`/`subject_id`).
- **Causer**: The model that caused the action, typically the authenticated user (polymorphic `causer_type`/`causer_id`).
- **LogOptions**: Fluent configuration object returned by `getActivitylogOptions()` on models using the `LogsActivity` trait.
- **ActivityEvent**: Enum with cases `Created`, `Updated`, `Deleted`, `Restored`.
- **`attribute_changes`** column: stores `{"attributes": {...}, "old": {...}}` for tracked model changes.
- **`properties`** column: stores custom user data set via `withProperties()`.

## Traits

### `LogsActivity`

Add to models to automatically log create/update/delete events. Optionally implement `getActivitylogOptions()` to configure which attributes to track (defaults to logging events without attribute changes).

```php
use Spatie\Activitylog\Models\Concerns\LogsActivity;
use Spatie\Activitylog\Support\LogOptions;

class Article extends Model
{
    use LogsActivity;

    public function getActivitylogOptions(): LogOptions
    {
        return LogOptions::defaults()
            ->logFillable()
            ->logOnlyDirty()
            ->dontLogEmptyChanges();
    }
}
```

### `CausesActivity`

Add to user/causer models. Provides `activitiesAsCauser()` relationship.

### `HasActivity`

Combines `LogsActivity` and `CausesActivity`. Provides `activities()`, `activitiesAsSubject()`, and `activitiesAsCauser()`.

## Manual Logging

```php
activity()
    ->performedOn($article)
    ->causedBy($user)
    ->event(ActivityEvent::Updated)
    ->withProperties(['key' => 'value'])
    ->log('Article was updated');
```

## LogOptions Methods

| Method                                  | Description                                      |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `logFillable()`                         | Log all fillable attributes                      |
| `logAll()`                              | Log all attributes                               |
| `logOnly(array)`                        | Log specific attributes                          |
| `logExcept(array)`                      | Exclude attributes                               |
| `logOnlyDirty()`                        | Only log changed attributes                      |
| `dontLogEmptyChanges()`                 | Skip logging when no tracked attributes changed  |
| `dontLogIfAttributesChangedOnly(array)` | Ignore updates that only change these attributes |
| `useLogName(string)`                    | Set custom log name                              |
| `setDescriptionForEvent(Closure)`       | Custom description per event                     |
| `useAttributeRawValues(array)`          | Store raw (uncast) values                        |

## Querying Activities

```php
use Spatie\Activitylog\Models\Activity;
use Spatie\Activitylog\Enums\ActivityEvent;

Activity::forEvent(ActivityEvent::Created)->get();
Activity::causedBy($user)->get();
Activity::forSubject($article)->get();
Activity::inLog('orders')->get();
```

## Setting the causer

Override the causer for a block of code:

```php
use Spatie\Activitylog\Facades\Activity;

Activity::defaultCauser($admin, function () {
    // all activities here are caused by $admin
});

// or set globally for the rest of the request
Activity::defaultCauser($admin);
```

## Disabling Logging

```php
activity()->withoutLogging(function () {
    // no activities logged here
});
```

## Accessing Changes and Properties

```php
$activity = Activity::latest()->first();

// Tracked model changes (set automatically by LogsActivity)
$activity->attribute_changes; // Collection: {"attributes": {...}, "old": {...}}

// Custom user data (set via withProperties)
$activity->properties; // Collection
$activity->getProperty('key'); // single value
```

## Custom Activity Model

Set `activity_model` in `config/activitylog.php` to a class that extends `Model` and implements `Spatie\Activitylog\Contracts\Activity`. Use a custom model for custom table names or database connections.

## Customizing Actions

The package uses action classes (`LogActivityAction`, `CleanActivityLogAction`) that can be extended and swapped via config:

```php
// config/activitylog.php
'actions' => [
    'log_activity' => \App\Actions\CustomLogActivityAction::class,
    'clean_log' => \App\Actions\CustomCleanAction::class,
],
```

Custom action classes must extend the originals. Override protected methods (`save()`, `beforeActivityLogged()`, `resolveDescription()`, etc.) to customize behavior.

## Configuration

Key config options in `config/activitylog.php`:

- `enabled`: Master on/off switch (env: `ACTIVITYLOG_ENABLED`)
- `clean_after_days`: Days to keep records for `activitylog:clean` command
- `default_log_name`: Default log name (string)
- `default_auth_driver`: Auth driver for causer resolution
- `include_soft_deleted_subjects`: Include soft-deleted subjects
- `activity_model`: Custom Activity model class
- `default_except_attributes`: Globally excluded attributes
- `actions.log_activity`: Action class for logging activities
- `actions.clean_log`: Action class for cleaning old activities
